# Algorithms-Data-Structures-


This file catalogues many of the different Algorithms, and Data Structures that have helped shape my current understanding of both topics. 
My wish is that those with virgin understanding will find my take on the two topics particularly useful; especially in helping them gain their own foothold of mastery. 

But first, what is an Algorithm?

An algorithm describes a sequence of well-defined steps, illustrating how to arrive at a solution, from a problem. 
Be it may a sorting problem, a searching problem, or an optimisation problem, they each have corresponding algortitthms that can be used to solve those types of problem.
