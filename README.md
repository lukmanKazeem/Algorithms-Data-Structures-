# Algorithms-Data-Structures-


This file catalogues many of the different Algorithms, and Data Structures that have helped shape my current understanding of both topics. 
My wish is that those with virgin understanding will find my take on the two topics particularly useful; especially in helping them gain their own foothold of mastery. 

But first, lets define our terms...

    - What is an Algorithm?
        An  algorithm  describes  a  sequence  of  well-defined  steps, 
        illustrating  how  to  arrive  at  a  solution, from a problem. 
        Be  it  may  a  sorting  problem,  a  searching  problem, or an 
        optimisation problem,  they each have  corresponding Algorithms 
        that can be used to solve them. 

    - What is a Data-Structure?
        A Data-Structure describes the systematic way of representing
        data, for efficicnt use.
